#The sensor used in this project is MCP9700T-E
#It is an cheap temperature sesnor with built in compensation and linearization
#You can compensate for self heating of teh sensor but it is not used in this code.
# Accurecy is +-2 degrees C
#Volatge offset at 0 degrees C is 500mV
#Temperature coefficient is 10mV/degree C

#Function to calculate temperature: Vout = Tc * Ta * V0
#Vout   = Volate output from sensor
#Tc     = Temperature Coefficient
#Ta     = Ambient temperature
#T0     = Sensor output voltage at 0Â°C
